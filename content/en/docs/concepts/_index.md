description: This section covers the basic concepts of using Vixen.

Vixen is quite a paradigm shift from the legacy sequencers in the way the lighting concepts come together. In other software (including Vixen 2.x), it's normally a case of setting up your controllers, and then you have a list of numbered outputs that you can use to sequence on; that is, you're sequencing directly against the outputs/channels for the controller. However, in Vixen, these ideas have been broken down into two distinct areas: the *physical* components of your display (ie. the controllers and their outputs), and the *logical* or *abstract* components of your display (eg. the items or props or fixtures that you have). Additionally, because the design has been broken into these two parts, there's another important component to it: how they actually connect up (eg. how the items/fixtures relate to the controllers and outputs). These three components are called Controllers and Outputs (for the physical components); Elements and Groups (for the logical or abstract components); and Patching (to define how elements are connected to Controllers/Outputs).
