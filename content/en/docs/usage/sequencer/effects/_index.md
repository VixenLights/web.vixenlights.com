### String Based Effects ###

All effects support being applied to the elements in a string like format. Depending on the setup of the elements, groups of elements can form a representation of a string. Most effects apply their logic based on those groups acting like a string. This mode is designated by the Target being set to Strings

### Location Based Effects ###

Location based effects create their effects by using the relative location of the elements as defined by their location in the preview. When creating you elements, they should be positioned in relative space to each other the same as they would be when in the display. This allows the effect to apply its logic based on where they lie in 2D space. This is sometime referred to a whole house model, but int he case of Vixen it relates to whatever elements are in the group you place the effect. This can be your entire house or just several props. You have complete flexibility here based on your group definitions.

As of 3.5 release the following effects support rendering based on location or as strings: Balls, Bars, Border, Butterfly, Circles, Colorwash, Coutdown, Curtain, Picture, Pinwheel, Plasma, Text and Video. In the editor set the Target drop down to Locations.

### Intelligent Fixture Effects ###

Intelligent Fixture Effects are different than the other lighting effects in that most of the work is done by the fixture (DMX) hardware.  In other words Intelligent Fixture Effects are just exposing the
capabilities of the fixture hardware in easy to use effects.  Most fixture will only support a subset of these effects.  The effect help pages identify the requirements of the hardware for the effect
to be applicable.

### Device Action Effects ###

Device Action effects are intended to control items external to Vixen at precise times during a sequence.  External items might include special hardware devices or other software applications.
