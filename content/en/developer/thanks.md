Here at Vixen Lights, we believe in giving credit where credit is due. Anyone who has ever written software knows that sometimes things happen, performance issues, memory leaks, user interface issues etc. This page is dedicated to thanking those companies that have been so gracious as to allow the team to use their products at no charge so that we can continue to improve the product and give the community a better more reliable application to support each users blinky flashy <del>addiction</del> habit.

Thanks to the following:

* [JetBrains][1] Resarper Ultimate for development tools that make our life so much easier.
* [Atlassian][2] JIRA tools for managing and tracking our work.
* [Red Gate Software][3] Profiling tools that make our code better.

As we find more tools that are invaluable to our cause, we will add their link here. If you have an application that you believe would help us meet our goals, contact us.
